## âœ¨ Core Features

*   **Student Management:** Add and view student records with unique auto-incrementing IDs.
*   **Course Management:** Create and view courses, complete with names and associated credit values.
*   **Enrollment System:** Enroll students in multiple courses with robust validation to prevent duplicates or invalid entries.
*   **Grading System:** Assign letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) to students for their specific course enrollments.
*   **Automatic GPA Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays a student's Grade Point Average on a 4.0 scale, correctly weighted by course credits.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack & Core Concepts

*   **Language:** **C++**
*   **Core Principles:** **Object-Oriented Programming** (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
*   **Data Structures:** **Standard Template Library (STL)**, specifically `std::vector` for dynamic data storage.
*   **Build System:** **GNU Make** with a custom `Makefile` for efficient, automated compilation.
*   **File Organization:** Clean, multi-file architecture with **Header (`.h`)** and **Source (`.cpp`)** file separation for modularity and maintainability.
*   **Version Control:** **Git** and **GitHub** for source code management.
