\# C++ Student Information System



A comprehensive, command-line based Student Information System built in C++. This project was created to demonstrate core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, data management in C++, and a clean, multi-file project structure.



\## Features



\*   \*\*Student Management:\*\* Add and view student records, each assigned a unique ID.

\*   \*\*Course Management:\*\* Create and view courses, complete with names and credit values.

\*   \*\*Enrollment System:\*\* Enroll students in multiple courses with validation to prevent duplicates or errors.

\*   \*\*Grading System:\*\* Assign letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) to students for their specific course enrollments.

\*   \*\*Automatic GPA Calculation:\*\* Automatically calculates and displays a student's Grade Point Average based on a 4.0 scale, weighted by course credits.



\## Technical Skills Demonstrated



\*   \*\*Language:\*\* C++

\*   \*\*Core Concepts:\*\* Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation), Standard Template Library (STL `std::vector`), Header/Source file separation.

\*   \*\*Development Tools:\*\* `g++` compiler and the `make` build automation system with a custom `Makefile`.

\*   \*\*Version Control:\*\* Git for source code management.



\## How to Compile and Run



This project includes a `Makefile` for easy compilation in a Linux-like environment (such as MINGW64).
